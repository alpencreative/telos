			<h2>Why Telos for your Child</h2>
				<h4>A Focus on Healthy Child Development</h4>
					<p>TELOS Child Care exists to help school-age children develop optimally. TELOS (tel-las) is a Greek word that reflects the ultimate goal of human development: the ability to have healthy two-way relationships with others and with God.</p>
				<h4>How We Serve You and Your Child</h4>	
					<p>Serving children in grades K through 6, we provide before and after-school care, and full-day programs during school holidays. We provide transportation from Maidu and Excelsior schools, and academic assistance for homework support.</p>
					<p>Our flexible scheduling and hourly billing mean that we can accommodate your unique child care needs 24/7 (except school hours), five days a week. A special camp program is offered during the summer months.</p>
				<h4>Fun, Learning and Growing</h4>
					<p>The TELOS program includes reading and library resources, homework time, structured activities and projects as well as time for unstructured indoor and outdoor play. Especially popular are the 12-ft. Trampoline and the treehouse. Children make wide use of art materials, a music area, indoor soccer, Nerf dart tag and many creative toys and project materials.</p>
					<p>With our emphasis on physical activity, children recieve plenty of healthy and appealing snacks; nutritious meals are served for a modest fee when child care spans breakfast, lunch or dinner time.</p>

			<h2>The TELOS Difference</h2>
				<h4>The TELOS Building Blocks</h4>
					<h6>Outdoor Activities</h6>
						<p>Exercise, fresh air and adventure are some of the hallmarks of the TELOS experience. Not being confined to a building sets us apart.</p>
						<p>We have regular excursions to places of interest, exploration and recreation. Kids love riding scooters and bikes to local parks, exploring nearby creeks and geocaching, enjoying the snow and visiting the swimming pool weekly.</p>
					<h6>Mentorship and Social Skills</h6>
						<p>The exceptional 1:6 teacher-child ratio provides children with twice as much positive adult attention as other providers, whose more typical ratio is 1:14.</p>
						<p>The close interaction between teacher and child enables meaningful mentoring to support healthy socialization. Children learn how to make and sustain friendships and function successfully in a group setting. Sharing, teamwork and empathy and part of daily activities.</p>	
					<h6>Character Development</h6>
						<p>At the heart of TELOS is the acclaimed Core Essential Values character development curriculum, where children learn to treat others right, make smart decisions, and maximize their potential. We use a monthly value as a theme throughout all our activities.</p>
						<p>It has been proven that children exposed to this curriculum improve academically and behaviorally. Bullying goes down, while respect and achievement go up. We are proud of being a Core Essential Values child care facility.</p>

			<h2>A Model for Relationships*</h2>
				<p>TELOS Child Care helps the child learn a healthy model for relationships characterized by:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Empowerment- how to use his or her power to build others up, not to control or tear down</li>
					<li>Grace- the experience of being forgiven and learning to forgive others</li>
					<li>Unconditional Caring- learning that while behavior has consequences, it doesn't influence caring</li>
					<li>Connection- knowing others and experiencing the joy of being known</li>
				</ul>
